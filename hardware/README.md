### Misumi Extrusions

I ordered my aluminium extrusions from [Misumi](https://uk.misumi-ec.com).

Misumi does not sell to consumers. I had the luck of meeting a new friend in Discord from Germany who ordered frames for me and shipped them to Sweden. Per their recommendation I ordered the extrusions untapped and drilled, and saved myself half the cost. In addition I got to learn how to drill and tap aluminium. Fun!
