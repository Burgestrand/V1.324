# Panels

All panels where ordered in one go from [interglas.se](https://interglas.se/). They
were unable to accommodate measurements finer than whole millimeters, so I needed to adjust the DXFs
from the official repository.

This is where the adjusted drawings live. The original DXFs are from [VoronDesign/Voron-Trident](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident).

Interglas also wanted PDF drawings with annotated measurements. I might have gone a bit overboard.

## Notes

* Some of the original DXFs had odd measurements such as 139.9 and 140.1 — this is probably an error.
* I managed to adjust the measurements of all panels in-place except for the bottom, which I had to redo entirely. I was in a hurry so the bottom panel is the one with the widest margins.
