# Panels

I ordered all panels in one go from [interglas.se](https://interglas.se/shop/frontpage.html). They
were unable to accommodate measurements finer than whole millimeters, so I needed to adjust the DXFs
from the official repository.

I also noticed some of the DXFs had odd measurements where I expected them to be symmetric, so the
DXFs needed to be redone anyway.

I managed to adjust the measurements of all panels in-place except for the bottom, which I had to
redo entirely. I was in a hurry so the bottom panel is the one with the widest margins.

## The Order

- Three sheets of laser-cut acrylic.
  1. [Bottom](./Bottom.pdf) (369x369, [3PMMACl101][])
  2. [Deck](./Deck.pdf) (369x369, [3PMMA1750PINK][])
  3. [Rear](./Rear.pdf) (383x473, [3PMMA1750PINK][])
- Five sheets of cut-to-measure acrylic.
  1. 2 x [4CE03CUT][], 191x473 (two doors)
  2. 2 x [4CE03CUT][], 383x473 (two sides)
  3. 1 x [4CE03CUT][], 383x383 (one top)
